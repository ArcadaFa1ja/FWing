# App Documentation

The "App" segment of the project primarily focuses on the Vue.js frontend application, detailing the architecture, navigation, state management, and key components that facilitate user interaction and functionality within the application.

## Overview

The frontend application is designed as a single-page application (SPA) using Vue.js, leveraging Vue Router for navigation and optionally Vuex for state management, to provide a dynamic and responsive user experience. The application integrates with the backend server via API calls to fetch and manipulate data, including user settings, events, weather, and restaurant menus.
### Project Setup

    Framework: Vue.js
    Routing: Vue Router
    HTTP Requests: Axios for API calls

### Installation and Running Locally

    Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
    Clone the project repository.
    Navigate to the client directory.
    Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
    Serve the application locally:
```bash
 npm run serve
```

    The application will be available at http://localhost:8080.

## Directory Structure

    src/
        assets/: Static assets like images and global styles.
        components/: Vue components for specific features (e.g., weather display, settings form).
        App.vue: The main application component that ties everything together.
        main.js: The entry point for the Vue application.

## Navigation with Vue Router

    Configuration: The router is configured in src/router/index.js, defining paths and associated components for the application's routes.
    Usage: Navigation is achieved using <router-link> for declarative links or this.$router.push('/path') for programmatic navigation.
    Routes Example:

```javascript

    const routes = [
      {
        path: '/',
        name: 'Home',
        component: Home
      },
      {
        path: '/settings',
        name: 'Settings',
        // Lazy-loaded component
        component: () => import('../views/Settings.vue')
      }
    ];
```
## State Management with Vuex (Optional)

    Purpose: Manages application state globally, useful for sharing data between components.
    Store Setup: Located in src/store/index.js, defines the state, mutations, actions, and getters.
    Usage: Components access the state directly through $store.state or use mapState helper; mutations and actions are called via $store.commit('mutationName') and $store.dispatch('actionName').

## Key Components

    NavBar: Handles user navigation across different parts of the application.
    UserSettingsForm: Allows users to update their preferences and settings.
    WeatherWidget: Displays weather information based on the user's location.
    EventList: Shows upcoming events fetched from the backend or external APIs.

## API Integration

    Axios: Used for sending HTTP requests to the backend API.
    Example Call: Fetching user settings

```javascript

    axios.get(`/api/getUserSettings/${userId}`)
         .then(response => {
           // Handle success
           console.log(response.data);
         })
         .catch(error => {
           // Handle error
           console.error(error);
         });
```
### Development Practices

    Component Design: Components are designed to be reusable and modular.
    Code Splitting: Use dynamic imports for routes and components to improve loading times.
